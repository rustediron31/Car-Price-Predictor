# Car-Price-Predictor
The Car Price Predictor is a machine learning project designed to estimate the prices of cars based on various features such as brand, model, mileage, engine type, and more
Features

Preprocesses data by handling missing values and outliers.

Encodes categorical variables using OneHotEncoder.

Implements linear regression for price prediction.

Uses pipelines to streamline preprocessing and model training.

Provides an easy-to-use interface for predicting car prices.

Data Cleaning

Missing Values: Handles missing data using imputation or removal.

Outliers: Identifies and removes outliers to improve model performance.

Feature Scaling: Applies normalization or standardization where necessary.

Encoding: Converts categorical variables into numerical format using one-hot encoding.

Model Building

OneHotEncoder: Encodes categorical data into numerical format.

Linear Regression: Builds a simple and interpretable model for prediction.

Pipeline: Combines data preprocessing and modeling into a single, cohesive workflow.
